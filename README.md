# SpectrumPM
SpectrumPM is an implementation of the [Spectrum](https://github.com/cooldogedev/Spectrum) proxy for PocketMine-MP servers.

## Installation
Make sure you disable encryption in your `pocketmine.yml` file. This is required for the proxy to work.

SpectrumPM requires special binaries, which can be found [here](https://github.com/NetherGamesMC/php-build-scripts/releases). Additionally, ensure that you have `ext-snappy` and `ext-ffi` installed.
